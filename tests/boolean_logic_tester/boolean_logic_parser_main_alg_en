DEFINITIONS:

1. Input prompt          - the string like "dchernik@c4r2s6: " that is displayed
                           after we issue commands to the shell; 

2. Prompt                - the user’s request (a sequence of symbols that we enter
                           after the input prompt);

3. Operand               - a program executed by our shell. At this stage, operands
                           are script-letters such as a, b, c, etc.; 

4. Operator              - one of the logical operators &&, ||, or also the
                           pipe symbol | .

ALGORITHM (DRAFT):

...

Print the input prompt;

Receive the user prompt via the readline function;

...

1. Look at the first symbol of the prompt;

2. IF this symbol is ( ;

	2.1. Launch the subshell, passing to it all the content
         that is inside the parentheses;

	2.2. Receive the return value of the subshell and store it (the
         exit code of the last operation executed inside the parentheses); 

	2.3. Skip everything that is inside the parentheses;

3. IF this is an operand AND the next operator is NOT | ;

	3.1. Execute this operand;

	3.2. Store the return value;

	3.3. Check which operator comes next;

	3.4. IF this operator is && ;

		3.4.1. IF the previous return value is ERROR;

			3.4.1.1. IF the next token is ( ;

				3.4.1.1.1. Skip everything from ( to );

				3.4.1.1.2. JUMP 3.3 (move forward through the prompt);

			3.4.1.2. IF the next token is an operand;

				3.4.1.2.1. Skip this operand;

				3.4.1.2.2. JUMP 3.3 (move forward);

		3.4.2. IF the previous return value is SUCCESS;

			3.4.2.1. IF the next token is ( ;

				3.4.2.1.1. Launch the subshell, passing to it all
                           the content insdie the parentheses;

				3.4.2.1.2. Receive the return value of the
                           subshell and store it;

				3.4.2.1.3. We skip everything that is inside the parentheses;

				3.4.2.1.4. JUMP 3.3 (move forward);

			3.4.2.2. IF the next token is an operand;

				3.4.2.2.1. Execute this operand;

				3.4.2.2.2. Store its return value;

				3.4.2.2.3. JUMP 3.3 (move forward);

	3.5. IF this operator is || ;

		3.5.1. IF the previous return value is ERROR;

			3.5.1.1. IF the next token is ( ;

				3.5.1.1.1. Launch the subshell, passing to it all
                           the content inside the parentheses;

				3.5.1.1.2. Receive the return value of the subshell
                           and store it;

				3.5.1.1.3. Skip everything that is inside the parentheses;

				3.5.1.1.4. JUMP 3.3 (move forward);

			3.5.1.2. IF the next token is an operand;

				3.5.1.2.1. Execute this operand;

				3.5.1.2.2. Store its return value;

				3.5.1.2.3. JUMP 3.3 (move forward);

		3.5.2. IF the previous return value is SUCCESS;

			3.5.2.1. IF the next token is ( ;

				3.5.2.1.1. Skip everything from ( to );

				3.5.2.1.1. JUMP 3.3 (move forward);

			3.5.2.2. IF the next token is an operand;

				3.5.2.2.1. Skip this operand;

				3.5.2.2.2. JUMP 3.3 (move forward);

	3.6. IF this is an operand AND the next operator is | ;
